# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 4: April 9, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned a lot of git commands that I haven't had to use in my classwork yet. Installed live server for Visual Studio Code, but it wasn't very live.

**Thoughts** These commands make me want to find another's repository so that I can practice...I believe I can do more towards my goal than I'm currently doing.

### Day 5: April 10, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started a YouTube tutorial for creating a webpage. For my class, I am going back to the beginning of Unit 2(three weeks in) with the readings, videos and homework assignments. I fell behind and did a lot of spot reading. So I want some depth this time. In all I may have did 1-1.5 hours outside of class. 

**Thoughts** I'm not expecting the YouTube playlist to change my life with HTML, CSS or even JS. It's been in my saved playlists for a while so with all the coding for class I've been doing I want to jump back into coding for me. I was doing JavaScript before the course. Class has been Python with stint of HTML and CSS.

### Day 4: April 9, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I got miniconda set up like the coursework intended. It works fine at the moment. I also completed Web Caesar assignment.

**Thoughts** Why do things that work one day fail the next?

### Day 3: April 8, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a Flask tutorial and started to work with conda. Both are needed to complete another assignment, web-caesar. This assignment is based off some code from the ceasar encryption I wrote a couple of weeks ago. Most of my conda commands can only be completed in Anaconda Prompt which was still trial and error to get started. Some of my classmates can work in GitBash.

**Thoughts** Getting more comfortable with my limited knowledge of git commands. But conda is a whole new ball game.

### Day 2: April 7, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I finished my HTML-me-something assignment. It has CSS.

**Thoughts** I'm still getting the hang of Git and Github and the terminal, as well. I meant to have four commits instead of five.  I feel better about than I did a year ago when I started my Github account.

### Day 1: April 6, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I did the HTML portion of my LaunchCode 101 assignment. It's called HTML Me Something. I used images as links. I used news html elements - article, main, footer, and header.

**Thoughts** I want to edit the content of the HTML, but I believe I can go ahead to the CSS portion. I hope I used the new HTML elements correctly. First day of challenge!!!
