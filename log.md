# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 12: April 17, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Validation day 3. It's coming together slowly.

**Thoughts**: I feel better about validation today than I did yesterday. I can't write anything from scratch but the syntax is looking clearer. 

### Day 11: April 16, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More validation study. I didn't get as much done as I would have liked. 

**Thoughts**: Validation confuses me.

### Day 10: April 15, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a study day. Validation in python.

**Thoughts**: None about today's content. But I'm looking forward to tomorrow! Also it's day 10!

### Day 9: April 14, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I did hands-on stuff for class. But I also restarted on an old project that was started on GitHub, then worked on elsewhere, and is now returning. I had to delete one unneeded branch and rename another. It wasn't too bad.

**Thoughts** Why did I create two branches? And from where did the name "iamvalecia-patch-1" come? Was it auto-generated? Also I've learned how to name a git file since then, but I'm keeping this name for simplicity and nostalgia.

### Day 8: April 13, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Polishing up on HTML forms.

**Thoughts** I think I found a solution to an old problem with some code I wrote months ago. 

### Day 7: April 12, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was just a video tutorial day. I took some notes, as well. I'm learning how the web works.

**Thoughts** I hope to do more tomorrow with my classwork, as well as with my personal projects. Today wasn't very hands-on.

### Day 6: April 11, 2019 Thurday

**Today's Progress**: I learned a lot of git commands that I haven't had to use in my classwork yet. Installed live server for Visual Studio Code, but it wasn't very live.

**Thoughts** These commands make me want to find another's repository so that I can practice...I believe I can do more towards my goal than I'm currently doing.

### Day 5: April 10, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started a YouTube tutorial for creating a webpage. For my class, I am going back to the beginning of Unit 2(three weeks in) with the readings, videos and homework assignments. I fell behind and did a lot of spot reading. So I want some depth this time. In all I may have did 1-1.5 hours outside of class. 

**Thoughts** I'm not expecting the YouTube playlist to change my life with HTML, CSS or even JS. It's been in my saved playlists for a while so with all the coding for class I've been doing I want to jump back into coding for me. I was doing JavaScript before the course. Class has been Python with stint of HTML and CSS.

### Day 4: April 9, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I got miniconda set up like the coursework intended. It works fine at the moment. I also completed Web Caesar assignment.

**Thoughts** Why do things that work one day fail the next?

### Day 3: April 8, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a Flask tutorial and started to work with conda. Both are needed to complete another assignment, web-caesar. This assignment is based off some code from the ceasar encryption I wrote a couple of weeks ago. Most of my conda commands can only be completed in Anaconda Prompt which was still trial and error to get started. Some of my classmates can work in GitBash.

**Thoughts** Getting more comfortable with my limited knowledge of git commands. But conda is a whole new ball game.

### Day 2: April 7, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I finished my HTML-me-something assignment. It has CSS.

**Thoughts** I'm still getting the hang of Git and Github and the terminal, as well. I meant to have four commits instead of five.  I feel better about than I did a year ago when I started my Github account.

### Day 1: April 6, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I did the HTML portion of my LaunchCode 101 assignment. It's called HTML Me Something. I used images as links. I used news html elements - article, main, footer, and header.

**Thoughts** I want to edit the content of the HTML, but I believe I can go ahead to the CSS portion. I hope I used the new HTML elements correctly. First day of challenge!!!
