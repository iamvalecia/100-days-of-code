# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 2: April 7, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I finished my HTML-me-something assignment. It has CSS.

**Thoughts** I'm still getting the hang of Git and Github and the terminal, as well. I feel better about than I did a year ago when I started my Github account.

### Day 1: April 6, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I did the HTML portion of my LaunchCode 101 assignment. It's called HTML Me Something. I used images as links. I used news html elements - article, main, footer, and header.

**Thoughts** I want to edit the content of the HTML, but I believe I can go ahead to the CSS portion. I hope I used the new HTML elements correctly. First day of challenge!!!
