# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 38: May 17, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Thanks to some advice that put me in the right direction I was able work through a phaser animation for with I was having problems. So that was a good thing! To accomplish it I created two variables but after commiting the changes I found that I didn't need them. So they may get axed. 

Also these animations aren't perfect. They just work.

**Thoughts** The advice came from Phaser's forum. Glad someone answered my question.

### Day 37: May 16, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I commited some changes to my game. The changes are from a day or two ago. I haven't pushed them yet. I worked some more on my game. 

**Thoughts** I am frustrated because I can't animate things the way I would like.

### Day 36: May 15, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I searched for answers about my jump animation problem from Day 34. I couldn't find one. I asked for help avenues but no reply yet. I got just a little more done on the game. Mostly just a bunch of trial and control-z.

**Thoughts** I think I wasted time looking for help when I should have just going.

### Day 35: May 14, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked some more on my game. He's collecting food now.

I have some experience with servers, not a lot though. Every Phaser tutorial says to set one up for the game for security reasons. But I think they leave out some steps after the server recommendations and download. I did notice a difference between my files and files from others. I tried to follow through with the suggestion but to no avail. 

Also I submitted my first README. It's for my todoList.

**Thoughts** Still fun.

### Day 34: May 13, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: After last night's update I did manage to load my spritesheet. Funny thing is the solution looks similar to something I had already tried. Maybe I was missing something really small or the page needed to reload.

Anyways I got the little guy moving and jumping. I'm following along with a different tutorial. I'll be making my own game as I follow along. Of course, when the tutorial is over it'll be up to me to finish the specifics of my game. It's going to be called Save-A-Dino, or something to the effect. I tried an animation for his jumping, so that he can have a different motion rather than him remaining in the same pose while moving up. This wasn't in the tutorial, but it seemed easy to create on my own. But I couldn't get it to work.

I pushed two things to github -- the game and an old todo list. The todo-list is in JavaScript. I don't want to forget the roots of JS! Plus this is in need of a retouch.

I will be adding readMe files soon.

**Thoughts** This was a good day.

### Day 33: May 12, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I tried to incorporate a spritesheet, not just a sole image, into my code. I wanted the appearance of movement. I couldn't get it to work. I'm still trying at the moment. Maybe I will get it tomorrow. #Phaser

**Thoughts** The more I read, the more their knowledge will become my own.

### Day 32: May 11, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work through the Phaser game tutorial. 

**Thoughts** I'm thinking of ways to branch out from tutorials once I'm done with this. I want to know that I know it.

### Day 31: May 10, 2019 Friday*

**Today's Progress**: I was working on Phaser tutorial. I wanted to know what made a picture a sprite, so I ventured out and made my own. It happens to look just like a simple square. That's okay for now. 

**Thoughts** This seems fun...Also I need to finish listing my new plans and meaningfully work on them.

1. [Frogger Game](https://academy.zenva.com) (tutorial)...I will try to find direct link to free tutorial.

### Day 30: May 8, 2019 Wednesday*

**Today's Progress**: I looked into Phaser again. I just followed along a video introducing it. I also started to put together new goals for the remainder of the challenge and revisited old code. 

**Thoughts** Let's have some fun.

### Day 29: May 6, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I forgot to update for May 6. I did some more SQL problem queries. I solved them, but I don't think I did them efficiently.

**Thoughts** Time will tell how well I solved those problems I suppose. I probably will have pages of code when others have three lines.

### Day 28: May 5, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some SQL query problems. One that challenged me was combining join, count, and where.

**Thoughts** I did okay with the time that I had today.

### Day 27: May 4, 2019 Saturday*

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday I skipped. Today I got in some time on my band website, the site I'm building for web dev YouTube tutorial. It's by a guy named Kyle, the same man whose tutorial I used for SQL. I also worked a little on classwork. Going to combine SQL with Python finally.

**Thoughts** I would have been really proud of myself if I had coded more after work. I managed to code before work.

### Day 26: May 2, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to get back in sync with LC101 curriculum. Finished up SQL basics. Laying out plan to complete my next assignment. Also looking into SQL hosting.

**Thoughts** I wasted a lot of time on the class resources for SQL. YouTube did me fine. But I may still need to fill in the gaps on things the video didn't cover as to not be behind my classmates. The video was really good though.

### Day 25: May 1, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the youtube video from yesterday. Also set up the environment for my classwork in the recommended server. 

**Thoughts** I feel so much more confident with SQL now. I also like the server used in the YouTube tutorial better.

### Day 24: April 30, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I may finally be making a headway with SQL. I'm abandoning the curriculum for a second for something I think is more concise. Then I'm going to dive into the graded assignment.

**Thoughts** I hope to keep up the momentum.

### Day 23: April 29, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I didn't intend to make a GitHub page today but I did. Nothing big on my part, I just selected an option from a drop-down menu. But I think it's cool that I can share this page with an actual URL now. I also worked more on HTML. I hope to do some SQL reading before I go to bed.

**Thoughts** Again I think GitHub pages is cool. I want to look more into hosting a whole website here. My reading and experiment tells me it's a no-go for Python or Node.js though.

### Day 22: April 28, 2019 Sunday*

**Today's Progress**: No classwork today. Just HTML.

**Thoughts**: I skipped a day. I needed a break. Today I eased back in with non-classwork.

### Day 21: April 26, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: More SQL. 

**Thoughts**: Hoping to get to a point where I can integrate this with the Python I've been learning.

### Day 20: April 25, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More SQL. 

**Thoughts**: I can do better tomorrow. I got my hour in, but it was very sporadic.

### Day 19: April 24, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More SQL. 

**Thoughts**: It seems like a cool language. I hope to dig more into it tomorrow.

### Day 18: April 23, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started off working on SQL for class. It seemed a bit tedious, so I switched to HTML and JavaScript, my personal endeavors.

**Thoughts**: Maybe I need a better resource than w3schools.com, which I was pointed to by the curriculum. 

### Day 17: April 22, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a bit of a rest day. I did make a correction in my assignment just moments before it was due. I noticed it and rewrote the function in a couple of minutes.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow more SQL.

### Day 16: April 21, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my assignment.

**Thoughts**: I would like to make it better. I would like the URL to match the content of the page. But I'm not sure how to do that without displaying sensitive info in the URL(get method). What I want isn't a requirement, so I won't exhaust myself too much about it.

1. [user-signup](https://github.com/iamvalecia/user-signup)

### Day 15: April 20, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started to read up on SQL, but main focus is on my assignment called User-Signup. It includes forms, validation, templates, html, and Python.

**Thoughts**: I think it's possible to complete this by Monday. I'm a bit behind. This challenge has helped me stay focused. Based on my thoughts during the tutorials, I'm surprised that I feel so confident. But I do. If I continue to work hard I think I got this.

### Day 14: April 19, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Crash course in templates. Template Extensions. render_template method. 

**Thoughts**: It wasn't officially named a crash course, but it felt like a lot of info in a short period. Time to move on to the graded assignment. On the upside I sort of know how to make a todo list in Python and Javascript. But despite the time since I performed the task I believe doing it with JavaScript is more comfortable.

1. [Using Jinja2 Templates in Flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exR1kxpd1cY)(tutorial, one of)

### Day 13: April 18, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Moved on to Jinja2. 

**Thoughts**: So many new downloads. This is so different from the vanilla JavaScript I was doing beforehand. I downloaded Phaser and Ruby to check it out, but that's it. Some of the downloads has been git related so I won't completely blame python. Something new to learn and import.

### Day 12: April 17, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Validation day 3. It's coming together slowly.

**Thoughts**: I feel better about validation today than I did yesterday. I can't write anything from scratch but the syntax is looking clearer. 

### Day 11: April 16, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More validation study. I didn't get as much done as I would have liked. 

**Thoughts**: Validation confuses me.

### Day 10: April 15, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a study day. Validation in python.

**Thoughts**: None about today's content. But I'm looking forward to tomorrow! Also it's day 10!

### Day 9: April 14, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I did hands-on stuff for class. But I also restarted on an old project that was started on GitHub, then worked on elsewhere, and is now returning. I had to delete one unneeded branch and rename another. It wasn't too bad.

**Thoughts** Why did I create two branches? And from where did the name "iamvalecia-patch-1" come? Was it auto-generated? Also I've learned how to name a git file since then, but I'm keeping this name for simplicity and nostalgia.

### Day 8: April 13, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Polishing up on HTML forms.

**Thoughts** I think I found a solution to an old problem with some code I wrote months ago. 

### Day 7: April 12, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was just a video tutorial day. I took some notes, as well. I'm learning how the web works.

**Thoughts** I hope to do more tomorrow with my classwork, as well as with my personal projects. Today wasn't very hands-on.

### Day 6: April 11, 2019 Thurday

**Today's Progress**: I learned a lot of git commands that I haven't had to use in my classwork yet. Installed live server for Visual Studio Code, but it wasn't very live.

**Thoughts** These commands make me want to find another's repository so that I can practice...I believe I can do more towards my goal than I'm currently doing.

### Day 5: April 10, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started a YouTube tutorial for creating a webpage. For my class, I am going back to the beginning of Unit 2(three weeks in) with the readings, videos and homework assignments. I fell behind and did a lot of spot reading. So I want some depth this time. In all I may have did 1-1.5 hours outside of class. 

**Thoughts** I'm not expecting the YouTube playlist to change my life with HTML, CSS or even JS. It's been in my saved playlists for a while so with all the coding for class I've been doing I want to jump back into coding for me. I was doing JavaScript before the course. Class has been Python with stint of HTML and CSS.

### Day 4: April 9, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I got miniconda set up like the coursework intended. It works fine at the moment. I also completed Web Caesar assignment.

**Thoughts** Why do things that work one day fail the next?

### Day 3: April 8, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a Flask tutorial and started to work with conda. Both are needed to complete another assignment, web-caesar. This assignment is based off some code from the ceasar encryption I wrote a couple of weeks ago. Most of my conda commands can only be completed in Anaconda Prompt which was still trial and error to get started. Some of my classmates can work in GitBash.

**Thoughts** Getting more comfortable with my limited knowledge of git commands. But conda is a whole new ball game.

### Day 2: April 7, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I finished my HTML-me-something assignment. It has CSS.

**Thoughts** I'm still getting the hang of Git and Github and the terminal, as well. I meant to have four commits instead of five.  I feel better about than I did a year ago when I started my Github account.

### Day 1: April 6, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I did the HTML portion of my LaunchCode 101 assignment. It's called HTML Me Something. I used images as links. I used news html elements - article, main, footer, and header.

**Thoughts** I want to edit the content of the HTML, but I believe I can go ahead to the CSS portion. I hope I used the new HTML elements correctly. First day of challenge!!!
