# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 17: April 22, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a bit of a rest day. I did make a correction in my assignment just moments before it was due. I noticed it and rewrote the function in a couple of minutes.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow more SQL.

### Day 16: April 21, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my assignment.

**Thoughts**: I would like to make it better. I would like the URL to match the content of the page. But I'm not sure how to do that without displaying sensitive info in the URL(get method). What I want isn't a requirement, so I won't exhaust myself too much about it.

### Day 15: April 20, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started to read up on SQL, but main focus is on my assignment called User-Signup. It includes forms, validation, templates, html, and Python.

**Thoughts**: I think it's possible to complete this by Monday. I'm a bit behind. This challenge has helped me stay focused. Based on my thoughts during the tutorials, I'm surprised that I feel so confident. But I do. If I continue to work hard I think I got this.

### Day 14: April 19, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Crash course in templates. Template Extensions. render_template method. 

**Thoughts**: It wasn't officially named a crash course, but it felt like a lot of info in a short period. Time to move on to the graded assignment. On the upside I sort of know how to make a todo list in Python and Javascript. But despite the time since I performed the task I believe doing it with JavaScript is more comfortable.

### Day 13: April 18, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Moved on to Jinja2. 

**Thoughts**: So many new downloads. This is so different from the vanilla JavaScript I was doing beforehand. I downloaded Phaser and Ruby to check it out, but that's it. Some of the downloads has been git related so I won't completely blame python. Something new to learn and import.

### Day 12: April 17, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Validation day 3. It's coming together slowly.

**Thoughts**: I feel better about validation today than I did yesterday. I can't write anything from scratch but the syntax is looking clearer. 

### Day 11: April 16, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More validation study. I didn't get as much done as I would have liked. 

**Thoughts**: Validation confuses me.

### Day 10: April 15, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a study day. Validation in python.

**Thoughts**: None about today's content. But I'm looking forward to tomorrow! Also it's day 10!

### Day 9: April 14, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I did hands-on stuff for class. But I also restarted on an old project that was started on GitHub, then worked on elsewhere, and is now returning. I had to delete one unneeded branch and rename another. It wasn't too bad.

**Thoughts** Why did I create two branches? And from where did the name "iamvalecia-patch-1" come? Was it auto-generated? Also I've learned how to name a git file since then, but I'm keeping this name for simplicity and nostalgia.

### Day 8: April 13, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Polishing up on HTML forms.

**Thoughts** I think I found a solution to an old problem with some code I wrote months ago. 

### Day 7: April 12, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was just a video tutorial day. I took some notes, as well. I'm learning how the web works.

**Thoughts** I hope to do more tomorrow with my classwork, as well as with my personal projects. Today wasn't very hands-on.

### Day 6: April 11, 2019 Thurday

**Today's Progress**: I learned a lot of git commands that I haven't had to use in my classwork yet. Installed live server for Visual Studio Code, but it wasn't very live.

**Thoughts** These commands make me want to find another's repository so that I can practice...I believe I can do more towards my goal than I'm currently doing.

### Day 5: April 10, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started a YouTube tutorial for creating a webpage. For my class, I am going back to the beginning of Unit 2(three weeks in) with the readings, videos and homework assignments. I fell behind and did a lot of spot reading. So I want some depth this time. In all I may have did 1-1.5 hours outside of class. 

**Thoughts** I'm not expecting the YouTube playlist to change my life with HTML, CSS or even JS. It's been in my saved playlists for a while so with all the coding for class I've been doing I want to jump back into coding for me. I was doing JavaScript before the course. Class has been Python with stint of HTML and CSS.

### Day 4: April 9, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I got miniconda set up like the coursework intended. It works fine at the moment. I also completed Web Caesar assignment.

**Thoughts** Why do things that work one day fail the next?

### Day 3: April 8, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a Flask tutorial and started to work with conda. Both are needed to complete another assignment, web-caesar. This assignment is based off some code from the ceasar encryption I wrote a couple of weeks ago. Most of my conda commands can only be completed in Anaconda Prompt which was still trial and error to get started. Some of my classmates can work in GitBash.

**Thoughts** Getting more comfortable with my limited knowledge of git commands. But conda is a whole new ball game.

### Day 2: April 7, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I finished my HTML-me-something assignment. It has CSS.

**Thoughts** I'm still getting the hang of Git and Github and the terminal, as well. I meant to have four commits instead of five.  I feel better about than I did a year ago when I started my Github account.

### Day 1: April 6, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I did the HTML portion of my LaunchCode 101 assignment. It's called HTML Me Something. I used images as links. I used news html elements - article, main, footer, and header.

**Thoughts** I want to edit the content of the HTML, but I believe I can go ahead to the CSS portion. I hope I used the new HTML elements correctly. First day of challenge!!!
